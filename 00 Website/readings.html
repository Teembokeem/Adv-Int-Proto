              <i class=> But the main problem with the virtual assistant is that it fosters an approach to the world that is literally thoughtless, 
                leaving users disinclined to sit out any particularly prolonged frustration of desire, and ever less critical about the processes 
                that result in the satisfaction of their needs and wants. </i>

              <p> I see the ramifications of that model. I choose to say, "Alexa, time", while wearing an Apple Watch. It's automatic now. But, I believe
                the reasoning behind this is not particularly desire or frustration but from learned convenience. For example, when I'm cooking, I don't
              necesarily have the hands to check the time or to look up to a mounted clock. I'm actually using a new motor function, my voice as a mechanism
            to bring about change. I think that's pretty powerful. I don't think that then using Alexa is a crutch, but it's developed into a reliable machine. </p>

              <i> Every time someone buys a low-end device of this type off a pallet at Costco or PCWorld, takes it home and plugs it in, they expand the property 
                of their local network that security professionals call its “attack surface,” or the total scope of exposure it presents to the world...
                The lesson here is that the security crisis of the internet of things was effectively inevitable, implicit in the ideology of ease and the fundamental 
                proposition of billions of cheap devices installed and managed by ordinary people. </i>

              <p>I only had a tangential understanding of cyber attacks, but after engaging with physical computing, the Particle Argon, and how serial connections work,
                this vulnerability really is frightening. Especially with the IoT projects I'm currently building for two classes, I'm aware of how flimsy the security of
                it is. I recently watched The Social Dilemma, and I see parallels between the arguments that Greenfield makes and that of the docummentary. Regulation is key.
                But, I believe that just as much as it has gotten easier to propagate and disperse IoT devices to every home, there have also been major improvements made
                to improve security.

              <i> At this largest scale, the internet of things appears to us as a body of rhetoric around the performance and behavior of the so-called “smart city.” This 
                is a place where the instrumentation of the urban fabric, and of all the people moving through the city, is driven by the desire to achieve a more efficient use 
                of space, energy and other resources. If the ambition beneath the instrumentation of the body is a nominal self-mastery, and that of the home convenience, the 
                ambition at the heart of the smart city is nothing other than control. </i>

              <p>I don't think control on the city level is inherently bad, as I'm surmising is the ambition behind this section of text. Sure, as humans, we can only futurecast 
                the most decent, appropriate, and positive lights of technology as it increasingly integrates with our lives. But I would like to believe that innovators that 
                are building systems for the functioning of a city consider the end goal of desperate needs to bring brick and mortar into a new age. Whether it be enhanced sur-
                veillance, localized cloud systems for data management and processing, or identification systems, we could all benefit from staying in line which, in turn, is also
                having a protective cowl over the fragile existence of ourselves and our loved ones.
